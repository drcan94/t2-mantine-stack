# Create T2M App

This is a [T2M Stack](https://t2m-stack.vercel.app/) project based on T3 Stack. 
My project is just a boilerplate for mantine-next-ts-prisma-next-auth-trpc (i called T2M)
You must learn t3 stack without tailwind css

Keep Reading! (Following Readme is from T3 stack official readme)
Only modified with Mantine instead of Tailwind

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?
